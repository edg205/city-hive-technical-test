Mongoid::Errors::InvalidFind (
message:
  Calling Document.find with nil is invalid.
summary:
  Document.find expects the parameters to be 1 or more ids, and will return a single document if 1 id is provided, otherwise an array of documents if multiple ids are provided.
resolution:
  Most likely this is caused by passing parameters directly through to the find, and the parameter either is not present or the key from which it is accessed is incorrect.):
